MFA is also available for administrator accounts accessing the VDS portal. This can be enabled per administrator on the admin detail page.

On the first login after enabling MFA, the user of admin will be prompted to enter an email address or mobile phone number. They'll receive a confirmation code to enter and confirm successful enrollment.
