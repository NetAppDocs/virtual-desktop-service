== Overview
This article covers the removal of VDS and NetApp control while maintaining WVD end user access. Going forward management would be with native Azure/Windows administration tools. After this process is complete it is recommended to contact cjsupport@netapp.com so that NetApp can clean up our back-end and billing systems.

== Initial State

* WVD Deployment
* TDS1 is FS Logix Fileshare
* TS1 is Session Host
* User has logged in and FS Logix disk was created in:
+
 \\****TSD1\****-Pro$\ProfileContainers (**** = Unique Company Code)

== Delete CW Agent Service

The CW Agent runs on every machine in the environment. The service that starts this process should be uninstalled with the following command on every VM in the environment. CWMGR1 can be skipped as that VM will be shut down and eventually deleted in most cases. Ideally this action would be run via scripted automation. The video below shows it done manually.

  C:\Program files\CloudWorkspace\CwAgent\CwAgent.exe -u

== Delete CW Agent Directory

The previous uninstall removed the service that launches CW Agent but the files remain. Delete the directory:

  "C:\Program Files\CloudWorkspace"

== Remove Startup Shortcuts

The startup items directory contains two shortcuts to files deleted in the previous step. To avoid end user error messages, these files should be deleted.

  "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp\Pen.lnk"
  "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp\CwRemoteApps.lnk"

== Unlink ‘Users’ and ‘Companies’ GPOs

There are three GPOs implemented by VDS. We recommend un-linking two of them and reviewing the content of the third.

Unlink:

* AADDC Users > Cloud Workspace Companies
* AADDC Users > Cloud Workspace Users

Review:

* AADDC Computers > Cloud Workspace Computers

== Shutdown CWMGR1

With the GPO Changes applied we can now shut down the CWMGR1 VM. Once continued WVD functionality is confirmed this VM can be deleted permanently.

In extremely rare cases there is a need to maintain this VM if another server role is running (e.g. DC, FTP Server…). In that event, three services can be disabled to disable the VDS functionality on CWMGR1:

* CW Agent (See Above)
* CW Automation Service
* CW VM Automation

== Delete NetApp VDS Service Accounts

The Azure AD service accounts used by VDS can be removed. Login in the Azure Management Portal and delete the users:

* CloudWorkspaceSVC
* CloudWorkspaceCASVC

Other user accounts can be retained:

* End users
* Azure administrator
* .tech domain admins

== Delete App Registrations

Two App Registrations are made when deploying VDS. These can be deleted:

* Cloud Workspace API
* Cloud Workspace WVD

== Delete Enterprise Applications

Two Enterprise Applications are deployed when deploying VDS. These can be deleted:

* Cloud Workspace
* Cloud Workspace Management API

== Confirm CWMGR1 is Stopped

Before testing that the end users can still connect, confirm the CWMGR1 is stopped for a realistic test.

== Login and End User

To confirm success, login as an end user and confirm functionality is maintained.
