== Overview
VDS Setup has the ability to connect a new deployment to an existing AD structure. These instruction cover that option in detail.
This article does not stand-alone, rather it is a detailed explanation of an alternative to the New AD option covered in the link:Deploying.Azure.AVD.Deploying_AVD_in_Azure.html[AVD Deployment Guide]

== Active Directory type
The next section defines the Active Directory deployment type for the VDS deployment. In this guide we will select Existing Windows Server Active Directory, which will leverage an AD structure that already exists.

== Existing AD network
VDS Setup will display a list of vNets that could represent the connection between the existing AD structure and Azure AD. The vNet that you select should have the an Azure-hosted DC that you have configured in Azure. In addition, the vNet will have Custom DNS settings pointed at the Azure-hosted DC.

== Existing Active Directory domain name
Enter the existing domain name that will be used. Note: you do not want to use the domain that is found in the Azure Portal under the Active Directory module, as it can cause DNS issues. The primary example of this is that users will not be able to access the that website (<yourdomain>.com, for example) from inside their desktop.

== Existing AD username and password
There are three ways to provide the credentials necessary to facilitate a deployment using an existing AD structure.

. Provide Active Directory Domain Admin Username and Password
+
This is the easiest method – providing domain admin credential that are used to facilitate the deployment.
+
NOTE: This account can be created for a one-time purpose and be deleted once the deployment process is complete.

. Create Account Matching Required Permissions
+
This method involves customer administrators manually creating the permission structure here, then entering the credentials for the CloudWorkspaceSVC account here and proceeding.

. Manual Deployment Process
+
Contact NetApp VDS Support for assistance configuring AD access with least privileged account principals.
