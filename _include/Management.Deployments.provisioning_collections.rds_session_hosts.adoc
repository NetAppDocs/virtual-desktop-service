=== RDS Session Host Update Process
VDS provides for an easy way to update session hosts in a RDS environment by using Provisioning Collections and the *Add Server* functionality. This process can be done without impacting end users and repeated over and over with subsequent image updates, building on previous image iterations.

.The RDS Session Host update process is as follows:
. Build a new VDI Provisioning Collection, customize and validate the collection per the instructions above.
.. Generally this Provisioning Collection will be built on the previous VM Template, emulating an "Open, Save As" process.
. Once the Provisioning Collection has validated, navigate to the _Workspace > Servers_ page, click *+ Add Server*

. Select *TS* as the *Server Role*
. Select the latest *VM Template*. Make the appropriate *Machine Size* and *Storage Type* selections based on your requirements. Leave *Data Drive* unchecked.
. Repeat this for the total number of Session Hosts required for the environment.
. Click *Add Server*, the session hosts will build based on the selected VM Template and starting coming online in as soon as 10-15 minutes (depending on the hypervisor).
.. Note that the Session Hosts currently in the environment will ultimately be decommissioned after these new host come online. Plan to build enough new hosts to be sufficient to support the entire workload in this environment.
. When a new host comes online, the default setting is to stay in *Disallow New Sessions*. For each session host, the *Allow New Sessions* toggle can be used to manage which hosts can receive new user sessions. This setting is accessed by editing the settings of each individual session host server. Once sufficient new hosts have been built and functionality has been confirmed, this setting can be managed on both the new and old hosts to route all new sessions to the new hosts. The old hosts, with *Allow New Sessions* set to *disabled*, can continue to run and host existing user sessions.

. As users log off of the old host(s), and with no new user sessions joining the old host(s), the old host(s) where *Sessions = 0* can be deleted by clicking the *Actions* icon and selecting *delete*.
