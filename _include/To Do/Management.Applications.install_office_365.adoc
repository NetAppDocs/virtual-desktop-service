== Manual steps overview

Licensing rules prevent Administrators from simply downloading Microsoft Office from logged in user’s account and installing it onto a shared terminal server and functioning for multiple users as expected. Instead, Administrators need to follow a specific process to install Office Pro Plus with the Shared Computer Activation flag activated.

=== Process steps summary

. Begin by downloading the Office Deployment Tool from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117

. Navigate to the Office Config tool: https://config.office.com/deploymentsettings.

NOTE: This guide will skip options beyond the minimum required and Shared Computer Activation. If other options are needed, you can learn more through Microsoft’s guide here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/deploy-office-365-proplus-from-the-cloud)

. Select the appropriate architecture for your deployment – 64 bit is recommended unless there a specific reason to use 32 bit (such as older Office plugins requiring 32 bit versions of Office).

. Select the desired Office apps and versions: Note: Only Office Pro Plus is supported for Shared Computer Activation. Regardless of what version of Office you have (Office 365 Pro Plus, Office 365 E3. Office 365 E5, Microsoft 365 Business, Microsoft 365 E3, Microsoft 365 E5) you will still install Office 365 Pro Plus here.

. This is the most important step of all – setting Product Activation to Shared Computer. Admins can optionally click the toggle that automatically accepts the EULA for the benefit of the user experience.

. After you click “Export”, the download for “Configuration.xml” will begin.

. Run the officedeploymenttool EXE/self extracting file (officedeploymenttool_11901-20022.exe is the version of the file at the time of this writing) you downloaded earlier, extract to a new folder (We’ll assume that “C:\Office” is used for this example), and copy the Configuration.xml file to the same directory (overwrite the sample one that was extracted already).

. Next, open Command Prompt as Administrator and change the directory to “C:\Office” (run “cd \Office”).

. Next, run “setup.exe /download Configuration.xml” (change “Configuration.xml” to match the XML file you exported in step 10) and do not be concerned if it seems like nothing is happening, this step can take a while.

. Finally, run “setup.exe /configure Configuration.xml” (again, adjusting the XML file name to match your file).

== Unsupported automated deployment

WARNING: This automated process relies on a custom ps1 and a pre-built xml.  It is unsupported in the sense that NetApp makes no warranty that it will work or the impact to any target machines.  The ps1 is hosted by NetApp and could change/disappear at any time.  We recommend this method be used as a template for building and hosting your own automated process.  This process was validate on Windows Server 2016 Datacenter 10.0.14393 and Windows 10 Enterprise for Virtual Desktop 10.0.18362 in Azure on Aug 30th, 2019.

=== Process steps summary

. Execute command to download and execute hosted .ps1
. ps1 downloads the hosted Office Deployment Configuration .xml (Screenshot of the Office Configuration Tool settings used for this XML is here)
. ps1 executes ProPlus Install referencing the .xml
. ps1 copies the Microsoft Office Shortcuts into a single folder for app publishing purposes

=== Customization steps

. Download and edit the hosted ps1 from http://getwvd.com/proplus_minus_onedrive.ps1
.. Built your own xml file (outlined above) and upload to your own URL
.. Edit the “$download” variable to point to your own URL your own configuration xml file
.. Edit the “$officeapps” variable to include all the shortcuts installed by your configuration xml file

. Upload the edited ps1 file to your own hosting URL
. Edit the Scripted Event Script to download and execute the customized and self-hosted ps1 (step 3.1. below)

=== Scripted events steps

This follows the same workflow as a normal App Install Scripted Event.  These instructions assume Chocolatey is already installed following the steps in the Application management Plan.
Office 365 ProPlus Automated Install with Chocolatey

To install O365 ProPlus you’ll create a new script with the following settings:

. No Script File
. Execute With: powershell.exe
. Arguments (Optional): Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘http://getwvd.com/proplus_minus_onedrive.ps1’))
. Edit the http://getwvd.com/proplus_minus_onedrive.ps1 and replace with the URL to your own hosted ps1 file.

Once the Script is saved, the next step is to associate that script with a Trigger. In this case we’ll trigger the script when an Application Install is requested in VDS.  See the Application Management Guide for details.
