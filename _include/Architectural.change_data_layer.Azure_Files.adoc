== Overview
Virtual Desktop Service deployment technologies allow for a variety of storage options depending on the underlying infrastructure. This guide addresses how to make a change to using Azure Files post-deployment.

=== Pre-requisites
* AD Connect installed and set up
* Azure global admin account
* AZFilesHybrid PowerShell module https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-files-samples/releases
* AZ PowerShell module
* ActiveDirectory PowerShell module

=== Create the new storage layer
. Log in to Azure with the global admin account
. Create a new Storage Account in the same location and resource group as the workspace
+

+
. Create the data, home, and pro file shares under the storage account

+

=== Set Up Active Directory
. Create a new Organization Unit named "`Storage Account`" under the Cloud Workspace > Cloud Worksapce Service Accounts OU
+

+
. Enable AD DS authentication (must be done using PowerShell) https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-ad-ds-enable
.. DomainAccountType should be “`ServiceLogonAccount`”
.. OraganizationalUnitDistinguishedName is the distinguished name of the OU created in the previous step (ie “`OU=Storage Account,OU=Cloud Workspace Service Accounts,OU=Cloud Workspace,DC=TrainingKrisG,DC=onmicrosoft,DC=com`”)

=== Set the Roles for the Shares
. In the Azure portal, give "`Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor`” role to CloudWorkspaceSVC and Level3 Technicians
+

+
. Give "Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor" role to the “`<company code>-all users`” group
+

+

=== Create the directories
. Create a directory in each share (data, home, pro) using the company code as the name (In this example, the company code is "`kift`")
+

+
. In the <company code> directory of the pro share, create a "`ProfileContainers`" directory
+

+
.. Choose Active Directory for Authentication method and click the Copy to clipboard icon in the lower right corner of the code
+

+
.. Log in to the CWMGR1 server with an account that is a member of the Level3 Technicians group
.. Run the copied code in PowerShell to map the drive
.. Do the same for each share while choosing a different drive letter for each
. Disable inheritance on the <company code> directories
. System and the AD Group ClientDHPAccess should have Full Control to the <company code> directories
. Domain Computers should have Full Control to the <company code> directory in the pro share as well as the ProfileContainers directory within
. The <company code>-all users AD group should have List folder/read data permissons to the <company code> directories in the home and pro shares
. The <company code>-all users AD group should have the below Special permissions for the directory in the data share
+

+
. The <company code>-all users AD group should have the Modify permission on the ProfileContainers directory

=== Update Group Policy Objects
. Update the GPO <company code> users located under Cloud Workspace > Cloud Workspace Companies > <company code> > <company code>-desktop users
.. Change the Home drive mapping to point the new home share
+

.. Change the Folder Redirection to point the home share for Desktop and Documents

. Log in to CWMGR1 with an account in the Level3 Technicians group and launch Command Center

=== Configure Backups
. It is recommended to set up and configure a backup policy for the new shares
. Create a new Recovery Services Vault in the same resource group
. Navigate to the vault and select Backup under Getting Started
. Choose Azure for where the workload is running and Azure file share for what you want to back up then click Backukp
. Select the storage account used to create the shares
. Add the shares to back up
. Edit and Create a backup policy that fits your needs
