TIP: This example activity will install this application when the app is added to the Workspace in the VDS interface. VDS Scripted Events offers many other types of activity triggers such as "Create Server" which could be used as an alternative to the "Application Install" Event Type. Using "Create Server" would simply run this app install against all newly created VMs in VDS. "Create Server" and other triggers are documented and can be explored link:Management.Scripted_Events.scripted_events.html[here].

NOTE: In order for a script in the repository to take any action, an activity must be created to associate that script with a selected trigger. In this case, the activity will link the existing script to the _Application Install_ trigger. Once configured, the action of adding this application to a workspace (from the _Workspace > Applications_ page in VDS) will trigger this script to install this application on all appropriate session hosts in the selected deployment.

.To create an Activity and link this script to an action:
. Navigate to the Scripted Events section in VDS
. Under _Activities_ click _+ Add Activity_
. In the opened dialog window enter the following information:
* *Name:* Enter `InstallAMDRadeonInstinctDrivers`
* *Description:* Optionally enter a description
* *Deployment* Select the desired deployment from dropdown
* *Script:* Select `InstallAMDRadeonInstinctDrivers` from the dropdown
* *Arguments:* Leave blank
* *Enabled checkbox:* `Check` the box
* *Event Type:* Select `Manual` from dropdown
* *Target Type:* Select the `Servers` radio button
* *Managed Servers:* `Check` the box for each VM that should receive this install.
