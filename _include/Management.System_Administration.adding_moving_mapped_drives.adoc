== Overview
By default there are three shared folders exposed to end user sessions. These folders are found on the defined storage layer. This could be on the file server (TSD1 or D1) or a storage service such as Azure Files, Azure NetApp Files, NetApp CVO and NetApp CVS.

To assist with clarity, this article will use an example customer with the company code “NECA.”  This example assumes a single TDS1 server has been deployed, named NECATSD1. We’ll work through the process of moving a folder to another VM (Named “NECAD1”). This strategy can be used to move between partition on the same machine or to another machine as shown in the following example…

Folders Starting Location:

* Data: NECATSD1\C:\data\NECA\ (TSD1means it is the first Terminal Server and also functions as the Data Server)
* FTP: NECATSD1\C:\ftp\NECA\
* Home: NECATSD1\C:\home\NECA\

Folders Ending Location:

* Data: NECAD1\G:\data\NECA\ (the D1means it is the 1st Data Server)
* FTP: The same process applies, no need to describe it 3x
* Home: The same process applies, no need to describe it 3x

== Add disk for G: on NECAD1

. In order to put the shared folder on the E: drive we’ll need to add one via the hypervisor (e.g. Azure Management Portal), then initialize and format it

. Copy the existing folder (on NECATSD1, C:\) path to the new location (on NECAD1, G:\)
. Copy the folder(s) from the original location to the new location.

== Gather Information From the Original Folder Share (NECATSD1, C:\data\NECA\)

. Share the new folder using the exact same path as the folder in the original location.
. Open the new NECAD1, G:\data\ folder and you’ll see a folder named the company code, “NECA” in our example.

. Note the security permissions of the original folder share:

. Here is the typical setup, however it is important to copy the original settings in case there are existing customizations we need to preserve. All other user/group permissions should be removed from the new folder share

** SYSTEM:All permissions allowed
** LocalClientDHPAccess (on the local machine):All permissions allowed
** ClientDHPAccess (on the domain): All permissions allowed
** NECA-all users (on the domain): All permissions except “Full Control” allowed

== Replicate the Sharing Path and Security Permissions to the New Shared Folder

. Go back to the new location (NECAD1, G:\data\NECA\ and share the NECA folder with the same network path (excluding the machine), in our example “neca-data$”
+

. For user security add all the users, set their permissions to match.
+

. Remove any other user/group permissions that may already exist.

== Edit Group Policy (Only if the folder moved to a new Machine)

. Next you’ll edit the Drive Maps in Group Policy Management Editor. For Azure AD Domain Services, the mapping is located in:
+
  “Cloud Workspace Users > User Configuration > Preferences > Windows Settings> Drive Maps”
+

. Once Group Policy updates, the next time each user connects, they’ll see the mapped drives which are pointed back to the new location.
. At this point you can delete the original folders, on NECATSD1, C:\.

== Troubleshooting

If the end user sees the mapped drives with a red X, right click the drive and select disconnect. Log out and back in the drive will be present correctly.
