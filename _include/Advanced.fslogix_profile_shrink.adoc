== Overview
VDS has a built-in profile shrink operation that runs nightly.  This automation will automatically shrink the FSLogix container of a user's profile if 5GB or more can be saved.  This automation runs nightly at 12:01am.  The 5GB threshold is configurable in DCConfig, found on the CWMGR1 server.
