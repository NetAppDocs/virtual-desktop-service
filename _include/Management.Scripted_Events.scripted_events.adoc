== Overview
Scripted Events provides the advanced administrator with a mechanism to create custom automation for system maintenance, user alerts, group policy management, or other events. Scripts can be designated to run as an executable process with arguments, or can be used as arguments for a different executable program. This functionality allows for scripts to be combined and nested to support complex customization and integration needs.

A detailed example of scripted events in action is found in the link:Management.Applications.application_entitlement_workflow.html[Application Entitlement Guide].

Additionally, Scripted Events allows for the creation of automation that does not require a script to process, rather the automation flow is launched by a system trigger and executes an existing program or system utility with optional arguments.

Scripts Events contains both a *repository* of scripts and *activities*.  Scripts contain the instructions on *what* to do while activities link the scripts with the appropriate trigger and target (*when and where*) for the script.

=== Repository
The Repository Tab shows a list of all scripts available to be deployed from within your VDS account.  This is a custom repository that is shared by all administrators in your VDS instance.  Access to Scripted Events can be managed on the _VDS > Admins > Permissions page_.

==== Customer Filter
Each VDS administrator organization has a private library of scripts created and/or customized by their organization.  These scripts are defined as Script Type "Customer." Customer scripts an be deleted and edited by any VDS administrator with appropriate admin permissions to the Scripted Events section.

==== Global Filter
NetApp also publishes and maintains a library of "Global" scripts that is the same across all VDS administrator organizations.  These scripts are defined as Script type "Global." Global scripts can not be edited or deleted by any VDS administrator.  Rather, Global scripts can be "Cloned" and the resulting script is a "Customer" script that can be edited and used.

==== Download Script
The ability to download the script file associated with a Scripted Event allows the VDS Administrator to review and edit the underlying script file prior to deployment.  Running a script that you don't fully understand is never advisable.

The following fields need to be completed to create a new script:

* *Name*
* *Include Script File*
** Yes - Allows for a script file (e.g. a .ps1 file) to be uploaded and executed by the "Execute With" executable.
** No - Removes the "Script File" field (below) and simply executes the "Execute With" and "Arguments" command
* *Script File*
** If _Include Script File = Yes_ this field is visible and allows for the upload of a script file.
* *Execute With*
** Defines the path of the executable that is used to execute the script file or the the command that is executed.
** For example, to execute with PowerShell the "Execute With" value would be _C:\Windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe_
* *Arguments*
** Defines any additional arguments that are executed against the "Executes With" command.
** VDS offers some context aware variables that can be used including:
*** %companycode% - Company code at runtime
*** %servername% - VM name at runtime
*** %samaccountname% - <username>.<companycode>
*** %applicationname% - Requested application name at runtime
*** %scriptname% - Script name at runtime
*** %username% - username@loginidentifier at runtime
* *Documentation URL*
** This field allows the writer of the script to link it to documentation found outside of VDS such as a Knowledge Base system used by the VDS admins' organization.

==== Edit Script
Clicking the name of a script in the repository opens a new page with details about the script and an action button to *edit*.

When editing a script the same fields are editable as documented above in the link:#add-script[Add Script] section.

On this script detail page, you can also *delete* the script and *download* any uploaded script file.
