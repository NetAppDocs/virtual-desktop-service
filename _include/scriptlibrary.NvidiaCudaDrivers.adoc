== Nvidia Cuda drivers overview
This script package installs/uninstalls _Nvidia Cuda Drivers_ using the Chocolatey package manager (https://chocolatey.org/) to do the deployment. Chocolatey is deployed by VDS when VMs are created but this script will also check and install Chocolatey as a prerequisite if it is missing.
