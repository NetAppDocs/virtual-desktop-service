== Overview
NetApp VDS includes a library of pre-defined scripted events that can be used directly in VDS environments and/or duplicated and used as the building blocks for custom scripted events.

For this application, this article covers both the link:#install-script[install] and link:#uninstall-script[uninstall] action.  For each of these two actions, there is a summary of the script and an example of an activity (trigger) that can be applied to implement the script.
