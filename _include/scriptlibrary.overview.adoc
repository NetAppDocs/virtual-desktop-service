== Global Scripts Overview
NetApp VDS includes a library of pre-defined scripted events that can be used directly in VDS environments and/or duplicated and used as the building blocks for custom scripted events.

For this application, this article covers both the install/enable and uninstall/disable action.

== Global Script Use
Built-in scripted events such as this one are pre-populated, checking the "global" filter checkbox will display them.

Global Scripted Events such as this one are read-only. They can be used as-is or the "Clone" function can be used to create a customer copy for editing and use.

The Clone button is found in the action menu on the Scripted Events page.
