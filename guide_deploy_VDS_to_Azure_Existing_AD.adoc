== Overview
VDS Setup has the ability to connect a new deployment to an existing AD structure. These instruction cover that option in detail.
This article does not stand-alone, rather it is a detailed explanation of an alternative to the New AD option covered in the link:guide_deploy_VDS_to_Azure.html[WVD Deployment Guide]

== Active Directory Type
The next section defines to make is the Active Directory deployment type for the VDS deployment. In this guide we will select Existing Windows Server Active Directory, which will leverage an AD structure that already exists.

== Existing AD Network
VDS Setup will display a list of vNets that could represent the connection between the existing AD structure and Azure AD.

== Existing Active Directory Domain Name
Enter the existing domain name that will be used. Note: you do not want to use the domain that is found in the Azure Portal under the Active Directory module, as it can cause DNS issues. The primary example of this is that users will not be able to access the that website (<yourdomain>.com, for example) from inside their desktop.

== Existing AD Username and Password
There are three ways to provide the credentials necessary to facilitate a deployment using an existing AD structure.
Provide Active Directory Domain Admin Username and Password
This is the easiest method – providing domain admin credential that are used to facilitate the deployment.
Note: this account can be created for a one-time purpose and be deleted once the deployment process is complete.
Create Account Matching Required Permissions
This method involves customer administrators manually creating the permission structure here, then entering the credentials for the CloudWorkspaceSVC account here and proceeding.
Manual Deployment Process
This option involves running the NetApp VDS Domain Preparation Tool, to build these permissions out automatically.

=== Access Method

PowerShell commands


.Requirements
. Run on a server OS as opposed to a Workstation OS
. Run on a server that is joined to the domain or is a domain controller
. Have PowerShell 5.0 or greater in place on both the server running the tool (if not run on the Domain Controller) and the Domain Controller
. Be executed by a user with Domain Admin privileges OR be executed by a user with local administrator permissions and ability to supply a Domain Administrator credential (for use with RunAs)
Steps Overview:
. Log into VDS Setup and extend permissions, then select the subscription you wish to deploy into
. Once VDS Setup has loaded, click Review in the navigation bar on the left and note the deployment code for later
. Log into any local domain joined machine (preferably Domain Controller, but any local domain joined machine will work) and run 3 actions with NetApp VDS Deployment Preparation Tool.
Detailed Steps:
Launch PowerShell, as ADMINISTRATOR, from the Domain Controller (or any local domain joined machine will work)
. Run the following commands, individually, to launch NetaApp VDS Deployment Preparation Tool:
+
`[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol =[System.Net.SecurityProtocolType]::'Ssl3','Tls','Tls11','Tls12';`
