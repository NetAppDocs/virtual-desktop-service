== Overview
NetApp VDS does not track or recommend different user endpoint devices.  We do recommend some basics, but this does not exclude other possible endpoint choices.

Remote Desktop environments can be access from a variety of endpoint devices.  Clients are available directly from Microsoft and 3rd party vendors.  NetApp VDS offers a custom connection client for Windows devices as well as a Web client compatible with HTML 5 browsers.

Windows Virtual Desktop environments can be accessed from a variety of endpoint devices.  Unlike RDS, WVD environments can only be accessed by Microsoft native clients.  Microsoft has published clients for Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS as well as a web client.  Additionally they have partnered with IGEL to offer a Linux-based thin client offering.


== End User Connection Options
=== Remote Desktop Services
==== NetApp VDS Windows Client
The NetApp VDS Client for Windows is the best way for users to connect to their RDS environment.  This simple installer allows the users to connect with just their user name and password.  No server or gateway configuration is required.  Printing and Local drive mapping are automatically enabled and this method has the highest performance.

Upon request, a branded version of this application can be created with the Partner’s logos and contact information.  Please contact support to request this.

The NetApp VDS Client can be downloaded from here: https://cwc.cloudworkspace.com/download/cwc-win-setup.exe

*Printing:* When connecting with the Virtual Desktop Client for Windows, printing is automatically setup using ThinPrint.

*Local File Access:* By default, the Virtual Desktop Client for Windows shares the Local device drives (HDD, USB & Network) with the cloud user session.  The user can browse and transfer data back and forth from the “This PC” location in Windows Explorer.  This functionality can be disabled by editing the workspace or user in VDS.

==== NetApp VDS Web Client
The NetApp VDS Web client can be accessed at https://login.cloudworkspace.com/

End users can also access their desktop via a webpage, as long as their browser supports HTML5.  Browser compatibility for HTML5 can be checked at https://html5test.com/

A fully branded version of this page can be created for NetApp VDS Partners.  The partner is required to provide an SSL cert and there is a small professional services fee to implement. Please contact support to begin the process.

*Printing:* When connecting via HTML5, printing from the Virtual Desktop generates a PDF that is downloaded in the browser and can then be printed locally.

*Local File Access:* When connecting via HTML5, the user can upload files to the Cloud Drive.  To do this the user will click the floating cloud icon, upload the file and the navigate to the “This PC > Cloud on…” location in Windows Explorer to access that file in the Virtual Desktop user session.


==== Manually Configured RDS Client
The second best connection method is to manually configure the Microsoft Remote Desktop application.  This is ideal for MacOs, Linux, iOS, Android and ThinClients.  The only requirement is that the device/software be able to connect via RDP and to configure an RDS Gateway.

The information needed to manually configure an RDP client is (Links go to where that information can be located):

* Username
* Password
* Server Address (a.k.a. PC Name)
* Gateway Address

*Printing:* When configuring a local RDP client, the user can optionally forward their printer to the cloud environment for printing.

*Local File Access:* When manually configuring an RDP client, the user can choose to share specific folders with the Virtual Desktop user session.

===== Locating the RDS Gateway Address

. Navigate to VDS (https://manage.cloudworkspace.com)
. Click Deployments
. Click the name of the deployment
. Locate RDP Gateway under Deployment Details

===== Locating the Server Address for Users on a Shared Terminal Server

Navigate to VDS (https://manage.cloudworkspace.com)

. Click Workspaces
. Click the name of the workspace
. Locate Server Address under Company Details
image:manual_client2.png[]

===== Locating the Server Address for VDI Users

. Navigate to VDS (https://manage.cloudworkspace.com)
. Click Workspaces
. Click the name of the workspace
. Locate Server Address under Company Details
image:manual_client3.png[]

. Click on the Users & Groups tab
. Click on the user name
. Locate the VDI Server address
image:manual_client4.png[]

. The server address for this vdi user is the Server address: dvy.ada.cloudworkspace.app but with the company code (e.g. dvy) replaced with the VDI Server value (e.g. DVYTS1)…

    e.g. DVYTS1.ada.cloudworkspace.app

==== Peripheral Devices
===== Printing

* The Virtual Desktop Client includes ThinPrint which passes local printers to the cloud desktop seamlessly.
* The HTML5 connection method downloads a PDF in the browser for local printing.
* The Microsoft Remote Desktop 8 App on MacOS allows the user to share printers into the cloud desktop

===== USB Peripherals

Items such as scanners, cameras, card readers, audio devices have mix results.  There is nothing unique about a Virtual Desktop deployment that will prevent this but the best choice is to test any devices that are required.  Your Sales Rep can help setup test accounts if required.

===== Bandwidth

* NetApp recommends a minimum of 150kb bandwidth per user.  Higher capacity will improve the user experience.
* Internet Latency under 100ms and very low Jitter are just as important.  KB Article
* Additional bandwidth needs will be introduced by your company’s use of VOIP, video streaming, audio streaming, and general Internet browsing.
* The amount of bandwidth consumed by the Virtual Desktop itself will be one of the smallest components when calculating user bandwidth requirements.

===== Local Device System Resources

* Local system resources like RAM, CPU, Network Cards and Graphics capabilities will cause variation in the user experience.
* This is MOST true of network and Graphics capability.
* 1 GB of RAM and a low-power processor on an inexpensive Windows device.  2-4 GB RAM is a recommended minimum.

=== Windows Virtual Desktop
==== WVD Windows Client

Download the Windows 7/10 client from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/connect-windows-7-10 and log in using the end user username and password. Note that Remote App and Desktop Connections (RADC), Remote Desktop Connection (mstsc), and the NetApp VDS Client for Windows application does not currently support the ability to log in to WVD instances.

==== WVD Browser Gateway

In a browser, navigate to the Azure Resource Manager-integrated version of the Windows Virtual Desktop web client at https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient and sign in with your user account.

NOTE: If you're using Windows Virtual Desktop (classic) without Azure Resource Manager integration, connect to your resources at https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/webclient instead.
